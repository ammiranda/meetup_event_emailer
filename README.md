## Meetup Emailer

### Overview

This application is designed to read JSON data for events (originally from Meetup.com) and inject it into a prompt to OpenAI to compose an email body. The email body is then sent to the configured recipients.

---

## Features

- Reads event data from a JSON file (e.g. Meetup.com export)
- Uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate a professional, friendly HTML email summarizing relevant events
- Focuses on technology and networking events for software engineers
- Sends the generated email to a configurable list of recipients via SMTP
- Fully configurable via environment variables
- Docker support for easy deployment

---

## How It Works

1. **Configuration**: Loads environment variables for API keys, SMTP credentials, and file paths.
2. **Data Loading**: Reads event data from a JSON file (see `data/events.json` for an example).
3. **Email Generation**: Passes the event data to OpenAI's API to generate an HTML email body tailored for networking and tech events.
4. **Email Sending**: Sends the generated email to the specified recipients using SMTP.

---

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file):

```
JSON_FILE_PATH=/app/data/events.json
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_email_password
SMTP_RECEIPENTS=recipient1@example.com,recipient2@example.com
```

- `JSON_FILE_PATH`: Path to the events JSON file
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP server details
- `SMTP_RECEIPENTS`: Comma-separated list of recipient email addresses

```sh
docker build --no-cache -t amiranda/meetup-emailer .

```
